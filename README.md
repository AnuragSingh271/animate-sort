# Getting Started with Animate Sort
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Animate Sort is a simple React App that sorts provided numbers or randomly generated numbers and shows an animation of the sorting process.

## Aim
The main objective of this app is to animate the sorting of the entered numbers or randomly generated numbers by the selected sorting algorithm.

## Available Scripts
To get started with **Animate Sort**, the basic CLI commands of **React** required are as follows:

###Installation
1. To install dependencies, enter the `npm install `command in the project directory.
This CLI command installs dependencies and calls the `install` from the *package.json, scripts* field.
2. See the section about [npm-install](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npm-install) for more information.

###Start Package

1. To start a package, enter the ``npm start`` command in the project directory.
This CLI command starts a package and runs the app in the development mode.
2. To view the running application, go to the URL [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in the browser.
The page will reload if you make edits. You can also see any lint errors in the console.

###Test Package
1. To test a package, enter the ``npm test`` command in the project directory.
This CLI command launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
2. See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

###Build Package

1. To build the app for production to the `build` folder, enter the `npm run build` command.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. This is the plumbing command called by `npm link` and `npm install`. This CLI command runs the *build* field from the *package.json, scripts* field. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!
2. See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### Remove Dependency

1. To remove the single build dependency from your project, enter the `npm run eject` command.
This CLI command enables to edit the configuration and script files. With this CLI command, either upgrade or downgrade the dependencies version on the ejected *package.json* file. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project. If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time.
**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**.
Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them.

2. To tweak the copied scripts, use all of the commands work correct except `eject`.
At this point you’re on your own. You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
